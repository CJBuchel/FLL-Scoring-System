# Overview
## What is the TMS?
The Tournament Management System (TMS) is an [open source] digital alternative designed to streamline scoring and management of teams in [FLL]. 
Operating on a locally hosted server to score, store and display team information without requiring a network connection.

Initially focused on robot game scoring, TMS has evolved to support more than just the odd score input and ranking board. 
Providing an ongoing list of features. Including:

- Schedule management and live shuffling
- Real-time pit displays of upcoming matches and judging sessions
- Native iOS builds for offline storage
- Managed timers with game sounds
- Dedicated screens for announcers, referees, and officials

With ongoing development, TMS aims to introduce further enhancements, reducing reliance on paper systems and streamlining the experience for FLL teams, volunteers and organizers alike.

## Background
The TMS (or Team Management System as it use to be called) was originally conceptualized by a group of [FLL volunteers] with the goal of a locally hosted web server to score and display teams and timers.
Which was extensively used each year by multiple events around the world, including our own events right here in WA.
Sadly in 2020 the original development team went dark for varying reasons, and was unable to continue supporting the project.

However in 2021, with the goal of still trying to bring some "flare" to the events hosted in WA. 
A new TMS project was founded.
Using the same idea with a different style, it was originally built for simple score inputs and game sounding timers.
And was specifically put together for Curtin University hosted events.
Eventually evolving into a more flexible and accessible project in 2023.
